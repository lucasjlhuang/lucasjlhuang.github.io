                    Keeping up our design momentum, I immediately switched gears into rapid-fire user-testing. With a group of 20 users I began
                    looking for pain-points or features I missed in the initial development of the MVP.<br><br>
                    
                    Through observational testing over video interviews and prepared surveys, I found that while the product worked, it
                    was tedious and slowing down our users. Leading to dissatisfaction and an inefficient flow.

                    Using the previous round of user-testing, and keeping in mind our findings from the initial user research, I created a final set
                    of designs. This included a re-thought out approach to giving our volunteers freedom and ease of use and an updated UI to officialize
                    the app. Further analytic tracking showed us that we moved in the right direction, with our task-connection rates increasing an additional 15%, and
                    task completion rates increasing another 30%.<br><br>
                    Finishing VoGro I laid out a design-roadmap for their future. Outlining design considerations such as a calendar feature,
                    a QR ID code for signing into events, and a user friendly onboarding process.
