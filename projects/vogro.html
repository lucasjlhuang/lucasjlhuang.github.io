                        VoGro is a volunteer management platform, initially designed to improve the lives of those impacted
                        by the pandemic. The platform evolved, encompassing
                        community and social opportunities as well. We wanted to make this platform as accessible as
                        possible. Following the development of our dashboard, we set out to enable a helping hand.</p>

                        and aid those limited by the pandemic and its restrictions. VoGro was struggling to connect
                        volunteers with community opportunities.
