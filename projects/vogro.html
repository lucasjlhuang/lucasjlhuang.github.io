                        VoGro is a volunteer management platform, initially designed to improve the lives of those impacted
                        by the pandemic. With more time and development we evolved, encompassing
                        community and social opportunities as well. We wanted to make this platform as accessible as
                        possible. Following the development of our dashboard, we set out to enable a helping hand.</p>

                    <p class="project-body">VoGro was created to help the community
                        and aid those limited by the pandemic and its restrictions. But VoGro was struggling to connect
                        volunteers to the community. There was limited outreach and ways to recruit.
                        How might we bring opportunities to volunteers in the midst of a pandemic, and bring help to those in need?
