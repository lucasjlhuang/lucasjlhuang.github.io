                        Hopefully you've played around and explored it to it's full extent. I wanted to create a unique experience where
                        the more you learned about me, the busier the desktop became, building on top of itself. Right now I have too many hobbies to count 
                        but my current obsessions are Magic the Gathering (best game ever), Warhammer 40k, snowboarding, print making,
                        and game design. If you found yourself going "Wow, I love that too!" please reach out so we can nerd out together. I'm a pretty
                        good teacher if you ever wanted to learn, I did spend 3 years teaching English in Asia after all.

                    <p class="about-title-text">Designer by accident</p>
                    <p class="about-body-text">Believe it or not, I ended up as a designer completely by accident. 
                        When I was applying to university I had no idea what I wanted to do.
                        All I knew was I liked creating. I made functional cars, bridges, bus stations with working electronics, and lived in autocad,
                        but never once touched digital products.
                        I only applied to Global Business and Digital Arts with Waterloo because my sister was already in the same program. 
                        It was a happy accident though, I slowly found love for creating websites and apps, and coding.
                        Having the opportunity to be creative but still use logic and research to solve my problems gave me a sense of fulfillment. 
                        From there I found opportunities to grow and challenge myself as a designer and i'm so happy I stumbled on it by accident.</p>
                    
                    <p class="about-title-text">Learning through exploration</p>
                    <p class="about-body-text">After graduating and experiencing job hunting during the mass tech layoffs in 2022, I decided to travel the world instead
                        and find ways to learn about design through exploration. I studied design in different cultures, built product overseas, and had a ton of adventures. 
                        I've learned a lot about communicating through design, because often times I didn't understand the language of where I was
                        and design was a way for me to reach others.<br><br>
                        That being said, I hope you love my portfolio because I loved making it.
