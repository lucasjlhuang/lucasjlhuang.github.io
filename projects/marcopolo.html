                        People don’t like giving information (especially about their child) to an app they don’t know well

                        “Create your child’s profile” sounds like committing to a service, when people may just want to check out the app
                        There’s very little context. How is this information used? How long is this going to take?  Is this part of the free trial?

                        all before getting to use the app (at which point, an in-app tutorial begins).

                <p class="project-body">  Judging from comments we’d received, the user journey is on a downwards trajectory 
                       and sets people up to start using the app on a negative note.<br><br>
                       <span class="marcopolo-quote">"We did use the app, and it was actually pretty good"</span><br><br>
                       Users are willing to sign up for a trial, but the process feels like a chore, acting as a barrier rather than a gateway to the product.

                        We also had some constraints to consider: many steps that were causing friction were crucial to the business
                        (e.g. users needing an account), or too baked-in for developers to change at the time (e.g. not allowing a trial without 
                        authorising a subscription). A completely reimagined “version 2” of the entire product was also in the works, so we wanted 
                        to bring this flow in line with it to create a new baseline, rather than working through small iterations at this stage.
                        <br><br>
                        I needed to find a way to make the process more emotionally uplifting, build excitement for the following experience, 
                        and most importantly, get more users into the trial.
                        <br><br><br>
                        Starting with a full audit, I accomplished this through three tactics:
                        <br><br>
                        🥇 Rearranging the flow to front-load the tasks with higher cognitive load
                        <br><br>
                        🥈 Redesigning the info screens to be less invasive and more transparent
                        <br><br>
                        🥉 Changing the tone through voice and visuals to be more fun

                <p class="mini-title">GETTING TO THE FIX</p>
                <p class="project-section-title">
                    Redesigning the flow for a smoother experience
                </p>
                <p class="project-body">Ideally, I’d wanted to test two versions of the original sign up flow, unaltered other than the screen order. 
                    I hypothesised that by moving the payment screen nearer the start of the process, users would have more energy to consider 
                    committing to a trial, and avoid the frustration of hitting a block after investing their time. It makes us look more honest 
                    upfront, and should also filter out lower quality users at the start, helping identify more meaningful drop-off issues on the 
                    following screens.
                        <br><br>
                        As we had next to no user testing budget, I reached out to the developers about A/B testing, but the product was built in a 
                        way that didn’t allow this with different screen orders. Instead, we decided to incorporate my suggested changes into the 
                        redesigned flow, and monitor differences between that and the original flow. Admittedly, it wasn’t a highly controlled test, 
                        but we were moving fast and could revert if the stats didn’t prove my theory.

                        I addressed this across the flow with more enthused copy and fun new visuals, playing on the personalisation 
                        aspect of the experience. I also added a progress indicator to show exactly how many steps to expect from the start

                <p class="project-body"> I rearranged the stages so that avatar choice came first, allowing parents to “meet” the Polos characters 
                        to see which personality might appeal best to their child, and changing the visuals to feel more like choices 
                        in a game UI. Our illustrators and 3D artists had also created some polished new renders and icons for our recent 
                        brand refresh, which along with the bright new colour palette, contributed to a higher quality, more dynamic feel. 
                        It also allowed the selected Polo to “guide” users through the rest of the flow.

                        Instead, we were hoping for some broad improvements to emerge—namely, for an increase in our install-to-trial 
                      conversion, and a reduction in drop-off at the profile creation screens.

                <p class="project-body">One month after implementing the redesigned sign-up flow, we were seeing marked improvements in the data.
                    <br><br>
                      The number of users starting the free trial had increased by around 20%, 
                        and drop-off was much more evenly distributed than before
                        <br><br>
                        It seemed that users weren’t so put off by the name and birthday screens any more, and we 
                     were even seeing more people passing the age gate (we’d changed it from solving a maths problem to 
                     entering a birth year to be more inclusive).
                    
                     <br><br>
                     <span class="marcopolo-quote">Because users had already committed to a trial and subscription,
                     they appeared to be more invested in the app, 
                    and less reluctant to enter information.</span><br><br>
                    
                    We were, however, still seeing a lot of drop off at the payment screen. 
                    Our growth analyst had predicted an increase (moving it forwards means a higher number of 
                    less-invested users would reach it), but this was more than we’d expected.

                </p>
                <p class="project-body"> Since implementing the new sign-up flow, I’d been working on some data-driven advertising with our marketing team. 
                        It was interesting to see what kind of tone and visuals influenced out target market the most, and it was surprisingly 
                        different from our in-app experience. For example, parents of young children responded best to lifestyle photography,
                         whereas our “selling” screen was very clean and informative. Of course the product itself shouldn’t look like an 
                         advertisement, but the goal was the same—to get users on the trial. Perhaps this stage needed to be more emotive?
                        <br><br>
                        Out next release was coming up, so I suggested we make some edits to the design. I created a banner featuring lifestyle
                         photography with 2D illustrations from the app content, and made some subtle changes with each iteration.
