                        “Create your child’s profile” sounds like committing to a service, when people may just want to check out the app
                        There’s very little context. How is this information used? How long is this going to take?  Is this part of the free trial?

                       Judging from comments we’d received, the user journey is on a downwards trajectory 
                       and sets people up to start using the app on a negative note.<br><br>

                       Users are willing to sign up for a trial, but the process feels like a chore, acting as a barrier rather than a gateway to the product.

                        We also had some constraints to consider: many steps that were causing friction were crucial to the business
                        (e.g. users needing an account), or too baked-in for developers to change at the time (e.g. not allowing a trial without 
                        authorising a subscription). A completely reimagined “version 2” of the entire product was also in the works, so we wanted 
                        to bring this flow in line with it to create a new baseline, rather than working through small iterations at this stage.
                        <br><br>
                        I needed to find a way to make the process more emotionally uplifting, build excitement for the following experience, 
                        and most importantly, get more users into the trial.

                        Starting with a full audit, I accomplished this through three tactics:
                        <br><br>
                        🥇 Rearranging the flow to front-load the tasks with higher cognitive load
                        <br><br>
                        🥈 Redesigning the info screens to be less invasive and more transparent
                        <br><br>
                        🥉 Changing the tone through voice and visuals to be more fun
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="project-section-title">Redesigning the flow for a smoother experience</p>
                     <p class="project-body">
                        Ideally, I’d wanted to test two versions of the original sign up flow, unaltered other than the screen order. I hypothesised that by moving the payment screen nearer the start of the process, users would have more energy to consider committing to a trial, and avoid the frustration of hitting a block after investing their time. It makes us look more honest upfront, and should also filter out lower quality users at the start, helping identify more meaningful drop-off issues on the following screens.
                        <br><br>
                        As we had next to no user testing budget, I reached out to the developers about A/B testing, but the product was built in a way that didn’t allow this with different screen orders. Instead, we decided to incorporate my suggested changes into the redesigned flow, and monitor differences between that and the original flow. Admittedly, it wasn’t a highly controlled test, but we were moving fast and could revert if the stats didn’t prove my theory.

                        The pricing screen itself had also turned out to be a problem. 
                        Users were complaining about confusing options, unexpected charges and information overload.

                        After discussing with the CEO, we decided to reduce the options to just a monthly and an annual plan.

                        I made the design much cleaner, highlighting our awards and credentials, 
                        showing the monthly costs at a similar height for easier comparison, and drawing more attention to the trial CTA. 
                        We also made use of the exit dialogue, which previously had unclear microcopy and provided no reason to stay.<br><br>

                     In a similar vein, we now only ask for a child’s birth month and year, rather than the full date. 
                     We needed this for roadmapped features that change the content depending on a child’s age, and it helped our 
                     education experts assess the suitability of the materials for different ages. I looked at more user-friendly options, 
                     such as selecting only an age in years, but there’s a big difference between the development of a child who has just turned 3, 
                     and one who is about to turn 4.

                        It was clear from user reviews and complaints that the sign-up felt like a chore. 
                        I addressed this across the flow with more enthused copy and fun new visuals, playing on the personalisation 
                        aspect of the experience. I also added a progress indicator to show exactly how many steps to expect from the start.

                        I rearranged the stages so that avatar choice came first, allowing parents to “meet” the Polos characters 
                        to see which personality might appeal best to their child, and changing the visuals to feel more like choices 
                        in a game UI. Our illustrators and 3D artists had also created some polished new renders and icons for our recent 
                        brand refresh, which along with the bright new colour palette, contributed to a higher quality, more dynamic feel. 
                        It also allowed the selected Polo to “guide” users through the rest of the flow.

                    I proceeded to use the child’s name/nickname throughout the flow, to elicit an invested feeling. 
                    I also addressed several visual and interaction consistency and quality problems that had contributed to a 
                    less polished (and less trustworthy) feel, as well as some accessibility issues. For example, the same sound effect 
                    had been used for selecting options and progressing to the next screen, icons were not using the same visual weights, 
                    and the disabled CTAs behaved differently on different screens.
                    <br><br>
                    The progress screen was actually not a loader at all—it was a timed animation to appease labour perception bias, 
                    and appear to be better personalising the app. This is a benevolent deception, designed to increase our product’s perceived value. 
                    It did, however, feel dated and sluggish. I addressed this by removing the groggy progress bar, including the child’s name, and 
                    creating a more dynamic animation with our updated icons.

                  Finally, the account creation process needed reworking. It was where we saw the 
                  third-highest drop off, and was currently very “bureaucratic” in appearance.

                    Where the original flow became very functional, I continued the upbeat visuals, 
                    with the same Polo guiding the process. The progress bar assures the user that this is the last step,
                    and examples of emails aim to increase opt-in rates.

                  We also decided to remove the email confirmation field. It was important that we collected correct addresses, 
                  but having to type it twice on a mobile device is a lot of work, adding negative friction at the end of an already 
                  tiring process. Instead, we added a simple yes/no check after submitting the form, with verification being prompted 
                  once reaching the admin area of the app later.

                        Since implementing the new sign-up flow, I’d been working on some data-driven advertising with our marketing team. 
                        It was interesting to see what kind of tone and visuals influenced out target market the most, and it was surprisingly 
                        different from our in-app experience. For example, parents of young children responded best to lifestyle photography,
                         whereas our “selling” screen was very clean and informative. Of course the product itself shouldn’t look like an 
                         advertisement, but the goal was the same—to get users on the trial. Perhaps this stage needed to be more emotive?
                        <br><br>
                        Out next release was coming up, so I suggested we make some edits to the design. I created a banner featuring lifestyle
                         photography with 2D illustrations from the app content, and made some subtle changes with each iteration.

                        Overall, the redesigned sign-up flow was achieving what we’d set out to do: getting over 
                        30% more users to start our trial. The project, however, could have benefitted from more user testing. 
                        Working on a very limited budget meant we’d had to base hypotheses on user reviews, analytics data and our 
                        own professional experience. Observing potential users completing the sign-up process might have uncovered more
                         specific, less measurable issues.<br><br>

                        I’d also have liked to create some more complex motion design for this flow—subtle animations 
                        could have enhanced the celebratory tone, and made signing up feel more like an achievement than a necessity. 
                        There are some further quality of life improvements, such as single-sign-on, or product-structuring like trials 
                        without subscriptions, that were simply not feasible with the development resources we had. A UX writer would also 
                        have been able to help us further dial-in the tone and clarity throughout the flow.<br>
